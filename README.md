# Lottery-dApp

## Background
This project was built to help me build upon the solidity skills I learned in my Solidity Inbox. I wanted to create a more full Dapp with an interactive front end using react that ran on the ethereum blockchain (testnet). 

## Requirements
Build a lottery system on the Ethereum blockchain which meets the following functional requirements. 
1) Anyone can enter the lottery.
2) To enter the lottery you must have a minimum deposit of 0.01 Eth. 
3) The manager of the lottery (the person who deployed the contract) can decide to close the lottery and select the winner. 
4) The winner will be selected randomly (pseudo)
5) When a winner is selected, all of the funds within the smart contract go to the winner. 
6) Once the contract winner is selected, the contract must reset and begin a new lottery.
